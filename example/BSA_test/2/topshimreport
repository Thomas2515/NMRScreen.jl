New TopShim run:

version = topshim 4.4.0
date = 2024-10-10
time = 11:55:05.699
command = topshim ss convcomp ordmax=8 tunea

FINE SHIMMING

Parameters:

probe = Z114073_0024
solvent = H2O+D2O
shim nucleus = 1H
nucleus optimised for = 19F
o1p (from lock) = 4.70 ppm

Results:

NOTE: No 19F B1-profile found. Optimizing shimming as if for NMR nucleus = 1H


1D Shimming:
Iteration 1: FWHM Before= 0.5 Hz, Target= 0.3 Hz, After= 0.2 Hz
Iteration 2: FWHM Before= 0.2 Hz, Target= 0.2 Hz, After= 0.9 Hz
Iteration 3: FWHM Before= 0.9 Hz, Target= 0.2 Hz, After= 0.2 Hz
Shim succeeded

Lineshape quality factor (1D spectrum, spinning) = 0.341
